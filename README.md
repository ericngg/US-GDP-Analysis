## Project Description
The dataset we are going to work on is the **Annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by state** from _Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce_.
Through analyzing and visualizing the data, we hope to provide an insight of the economic condition of anyone who is interested in the U.S. economy.
For example, how does the U.S. economic performance differ geographically? How did the U.S. economy develop over time?


## Technical description
This dataset is a static csv file but not a live data (api) since GDP is difficult to be provided timely by its nature.
The dataset can be filtered out depending on what the user wants to view. The dataset can be filtered by specific year, by states or region, by component, by industry, etc.

**Libraries that will or potentially be used:** shiny, readxl, ggplot2, plotly, RColorBrewer, htmlwidgets, and many data wrangling libraries

**Challenges that we anticipate:** Formating the UI, interactivity of the map for the user, and being able to manipulate the data to make it informative.
